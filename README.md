print('Hello, World')

My name is Andrej Trožić and currently I'm a Software Engineering student at 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka.

In future I see myself as a backend developer
with some convegency to full stack...

As every other CS student I have knowledge on the math fields like linear algebra(my favorite), mathematical analysis, discrete mathematics and statistics.
My programming skills are including C/C++ programming languages which I learned during my college session also 
as Java programming language as well.
Experienced with the Linux/Windows machines and with the team work.

Enought about schooling,
currently besides my college I have started my self-learning python programming language sessions and that's why I have created this github profile.
I want to create some real project's with python programming language, pycharm and Git/Github all combined and if you have any questions
feel free to ask. 

Greatest regards.
