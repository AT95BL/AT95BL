print('Hello, World')

My name is Andrej Trožić and currently I'm a Software Engineering student at 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka.

In future I see myself as a backend developer
with some convegency to full stack...

As every other CS student I have knowledge on the math fields like linear algebra(my favorite), mathematical analysis, discrete mathematics and statistics.
My programming skills are including C/C++ programming languages which I learned during my college session also 
as Java programming language as well.
Experienced with the Linux/Windows machines and with the team work.

Created this Github profile to motivate myself to work more and more...

Greatest regards.
